# Knowledge Graph Update Summary

## âœ… Changes Implemented

The knowledge graph has been successfully updated to reflect the new relationship structure with context-specific joins.

### Updated Graph Structure

#### Nodes (Tables)
- **Counterparty** (129 columns)
- **Trade** (38 columns)
- **Concentration** (7 columns)

#### Edges (Relationships) - 4 Total

1. **Counterparty â†’ Trade** (Default)
   - Join Keys: `Entity + Counterparty ID = Entity + Reporting Counterparty ID`
   - Context: `default`
   - Used for general trade queries

2. **Counterparty â†’ Concentration** (Country Level)
   - Join Keys: `Entity + Counterparty Country = Entity + Concentration Value`
   - Context: `For country level data`
   - Used when querying concentration by country

3. **Counterparty â†’ Concentration** (Sector Level)
   - Join Keys: `Entity + Counterparty Sector = Entity + Concentration Value`
   - Context: `For sector level data`
   - Used when querying concentration by sector

4. **Counterparty â†’ Concentration** (Rating Level)
   - Join Keys: `Entity + Internal Rating = Entity + Concentration Value`
   - Context: `For rating level data`
   - Used when querying concentration by rating

## Technical Changes

### 1. Graph Data Structure
Changed from `nx.DiGraph()` to `nx.MultiDiGraph()` to support multiple edges between the same pair of nodes.

**Why?** The original DiGraph only allows one edge between two nodes. Since we have 3 different relationships between Counterparty and Concentration (Country, Sector, Rating), we need MultiDiGraph.

### 2. Code Updates

#### [app.py:48](app.py#L48) - Graph Initialization
```python
self.graph = nx.MultiDiGraph()  # Changed from DiGraph
```

#### [app.py:81-121](app.py#L81-L121) - Get Join Relationships
Updated to iterate through all edges between node pairs:
```python
# Get all edges between these nodes (MultiDiGraph can have multiple)
edges_dict = self.graph.get_edge_data(start, end)

# Iterate through all edges between these two nodes
for edge_key, edge_data in edges_dict.items():
    # Process each edge...
```

#### [app.py:145-182](app.py#L145-L182) - Visualization
- Added support for MultiDiGraph edges using `edges(keys=True)`
- Added color coding for different contexts:
  - **Gray (#888)**: Default relationships
  - **Green (#4CAF50)**: Country level data
  - **Blue (#2196F3)**: Sector level data
  - **Orange (#FF9800)**: Rating level data

#### [app.py:257-287](app.py#L257-L287) - Export Graph Data
Updated to export all edges including their edge keys

### 3. Excel File Update

Updated `AI_SampleDataStruture.xlsx` Joins sheet:

| Table1 | Table2 | Join Key Table1 | Join Key Table2 | Context |
|--------|--------|----------------|----------------|---------|
| Counterparty | Trade | Entity+Counterparty ID | Entity+Reporting Counterparty ID | default |
| Counterparty | Concentration | Entity+Counterparty Country | Entity+Concentration Value | For country level data |
| Counterparty | Concentration | Entity+Counterparty Sector | Entity+Concentration Value | For sector level data |
| Counterparty | Concentration | Entity+Internal Rating | Entity+Concentration Value | For rating level data |

## Graph Statistics

- **Total Tables**: 3
- **Total Relationships**: 4 (up from 2)
- **Average Connections**: 2.67 (up from 1.33)
- **Is Connected**: Yes

## Visualization Features

### Color-Coded Edges
The visualization now uses different colors for different relationship contexts:

- **Default** (gray): Standard relationships
- **Country** (green): Country-level concentration queries
- **Sector** (blue): Sector-level concentration queries
- **Rating** (orange): Rating-level concentration queries

This makes it easy to visually distinguish between different types of relationships at a glance.

### Interactive Tooltips
Hover over any edge to see:
- Source and target tables
- Join keys
- Join type (INNER, LEFT, etc.)
- Context information

## How Context Filtering Works

When the LLM identifies a query context (Country, Sector, or Rating), the appropriate relationship is automatically selected:

### Example 1: Country Query
**User Query:** "Show concentration by country"
- **Identified Context:** Country
- **Selected Relationship:** Counterparty â†’ Concentration (Country level)
- **Join Keys Used:** `Counterparty Country = Concentration Value`

### Example 2: Sector Query
**User Query:** "What is the concentration in Financial Services sector?"
- **Identified Context:** Sector
- **Selected Relationship:** Counterparty â†’ Concentration (Sector level)
- **Join Keys Used:** `Counterparty Sector = Concentration Value`

### Example 3: Rating Query
**User Query:** "Show concentration by AAA rating"
- **Identified Context:** Rating
- **Selected Relationship:** Counterparty â†’ Concentration (Rating level)
- **Join Keys Used:** `Internal Rating = Concentration Value`

## Files Updated

1. **[app.py](app.py)** - Core application with MultiDiGraph support
2. **[AI_SampleDataStruture.xlsx](AI_SampleDataStruture.xlsx)** - Updated Joins sheet
3. **[knowledge_graph_data.json](knowledge_graph_data.json)** - Exported graph with 4 edges
4. **[knowledge_graph_visualization.html](knowledge_graph_visualization.html)** - Interactive visualization with color-coded edges

## Testing

Run the visualization test to verify:
```bash
cd "/Users/tanay/Desktop/Python POC/Text To SQL"
source venv/bin/activate
python test_visualization.py
```

Expected output:
```
âœ“ Loaded 3 tables
âœ“ Loaded 4 relationships
ðŸ“Š Graph Statistics:
  - Total Tables: 3
  - Total Relationships: 4
  - Average Connections: 2.67
  - Is Connected: True
```

## Next Steps

1. **View the Visualization**: Open `knowledge_graph_visualization.html` in your browser
2. **Test the App**: Run `streamlit run app.py` and navigate to the Knowledge Graph tab
3. **Test Queries**: Try queries with different contexts (country, sector, rating) to see context-aware join selection

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Joins**: The system now selects the correct join based on query context
2. **Visual Clarity**: Color-coded edges make relationships easy to understand
3. **Flexible Queries**: Support for multiple types of concentration analysis
4. **Maintainable**: Easy to add more context-specific relationships in the future

**Status**: âœ… Complete - All 4 relationships are now correctly loaded and visualized
